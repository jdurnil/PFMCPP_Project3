Create a branch named Part2

 tasks
 0) delete all of the plain english pseudo-code you added in Part1.
   don't forget to remove the blank lines left behind after you remove your comments
   - you should be left with only your UDTs.

// example:
// if you had something like this at the end of Part1e:
/*
Thing: Car Wash   
    5 properties:
        - number of vacuum cleaners
        - number of eco-friendly cleaning supplies
        - stores the amount of water used per week.
        - stores amount of profit made per week
        - number of cars serviced per day
    3 things it can do:
        - wash and wax car
        - charge customer
        - detail the car interior

    The above snippet is just an example showing you how to clean up your code.  
    Do not put your cleaned up code into a namespace like I have done here.

 1) write the definition for the Type that leftFoot and rightFoot are instantiations of.
    don't forget to define and implement the member functions 'stepForward()' and 'stepSize()'
    you should be able to deduce the return type of those functions based on their usage in Person::run()
    You'll need to insert the Person struct from the video in the space below.
 */

{   
    int stSize;
    void stepForward();
    int stepSize();
};

struct Person 
{
    int age;
    int height;
    float hairLength;
    float GPA;
    unsigned int SATScore;
    int distanceTraveled;
    Limb leftFoot, rightFoot;

    void run(bool startWithLeftFoot);
};

void Person::run(bool startWithLeftFoot)
{
   if(startWithLeftFoot)
   {
       leftFoot.stepForward();
       rightFoot.stepForward();
   }
   else
   {
       rightFoot.stepForward();
       leftFoot.stepForward();
   }

    distanceTraveled += rightFoot.stepSize() + leftFoot.stepSize();
}

void Limb::stepForward()
{
    std::cout << "took a step";
}

int Limb::stepSize()
{
    return stSize;
}



 /*
 2) provide implementations for the member functions you declared in your 10 user-defined types from the previous video outside of your UDT definitions.
    If you have 'unused parameter' warnings, you aren't using one of your function parameters in your implementation.
    Solution: use the parameter in your implementation.

    If you have 'shadows a field of <classname>' warnings, a local variable in the function has the same name as a class member.  
    This local variable could also be a function parameter with the same name as the class member.
    Solution: change the local variable's name so it is different from the class member variable's name.
 
 3) be sure to write the correct full qualified name for the nested type's member functions.
 
 4) After you finish defining each type/function, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
 if your code produces a -Wpadded warning, add '-Wno-padded' to the .replit file with the other compiler flags (-Weverything -Wno-missing-prototypes etc etc)
 If your code produces -Wconversion warnings, do NOT use static_cast<> to solve the warnings.  
 Casting has not been covered yet.
 Change your code so that no warnings are produced WITHOUT using casting.
 This usually means you have to use identical types for all variables used in an expression that is producing that conversion warning.
